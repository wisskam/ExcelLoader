### ExcelLoader 1.0

## About
This little program was created to simple load Excel files like xlsx or xls into database. 
From my experience, when you are working with data there is high chance that you will receive data 
in this format and SQL Management Studio will allow you to import such file but in my opinion quite painfull way.
With this simple tool, when you add database connection, you will be able to import and preview this file without such heavy tools!

## Installation
1. Run setup.exe 
2. That's it!

## Usage
1. Add SQL database in Database menu
2. Find excel file you want to import and press right mouse button on it, then select Excel Loader.
3. Select database from list.
4. Load!
